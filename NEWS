CHANGES IN KineticEval VERSION 1.0-1

NEW FEATURES

  - first release of the package KineticEval: it covers most features in KinGUII and was developed based on the package **mkinfit**; see package homepage for documentation and examples:
  http://github.com/zhenglei-gao/KineticEval
  
  - added two new optimization algorithms implementation
  
  - added a demo named `simple_KinEval`
  
  - added a function `update_kin_mod` to compare fitting results from different methods or algorithms.
  

MAJOR CHANGES

  - DFOP model for metabolite is re-established in the correct form.
  
  - Combined `IRLSkinfit.full`, `mkinfit.full`, `mcmckinfit.full` into a single function to avoid replicated codes.

BUG FIXES

  - fixed #1: when the inline R code returns `NA_real_`, the scientific
  notation of numbers will run into errors (thanks, Rafik)

  - fixed #2: when DFOP k=0 or g=0, the calculation of DT50 and DT90 run into errors.
